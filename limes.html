        <h3> Lime Video Game Project </h3>
        <h4> Advanced Topics in Computer Science; senior year of high school </h4>
        <p> During my senior year of high school, my computer science teacher of three years organized a specialized class for six seniors who had already completed the AP courses offered by the school. Some of the projects we were tasked with included building our own compilers from scratch and analyzing pixels to detect human emotion. </p>
        <p> In the project I have highlighted above I researched the conductability of lime juice and used that to re-create battleship on a Circuit Playground Express "all-in-one" board with built in sensory detection and LED lights. I used eight limes (four per player) and randomly marked one of the LED lights as one player's hidden ship. The other player had two attempts to try to sink this ship by pressing the limes in front of them. Although the game was rudamentary, it was the first time I had ever worked with Javascript as well as my first time seeing my code translate to a concrete game in front of me. This was a major learning milestone in my CS career, one of the many moments which propelled me to where I am today. </p>
