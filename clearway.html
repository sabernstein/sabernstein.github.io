        <h3> Clearway Scholarship Essay Contest Second Place Winner!</h3>
        <p> In October of this year I applied to Clearway Community Solar's Essay Contest. </p>
        <p> The prompt for 2020 was, "The climate crisis is among the most critical existential threats facing humankind. But today, we are also facing a new global crisis: the COVID-19 pandemic. Are there similarities in the threat of these two crises? How has the urgency of combating the climate change crisis been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis?" <p>
        <p> Due to my diligent research and thoughtful response, I was selected as Clearwayâ€™s 2020 runner-up essay winner, earning a $2,500 scholarship. My work is now published on their website. I am extremely proud and feel this essay format allowed me to explore the ways in which sustainability and technology are inextricably tied to our daily lives. </p>
