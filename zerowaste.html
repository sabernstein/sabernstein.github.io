        <h3> Zero-Waste Ryan Stadium Proposal </h3>
        <p> Almost as soon as I arrived on Northwestern's campus my freshman year, I searched for ways to get involved in sustainability. That is why I applied to join Northwestern's Associated Student Government Sustainability committee. I worked extremely hard alongside my fellow sub-committee members on a proposal to make Northwestern's football stadium zero-waste. Collaborating with my group members on a major project such as this was incredible experience. I was also able to gain connections within the administration who can help push this project and future projects forward. </p>
        <p> We studied current waste management practices at Ryan Field and Northwestern in general compared to other Big Ten institutions. We suggested the implemenation of monitored waste stations, hand-dryers, sustainable alternatives to food container products, and recycling of plastic film. Additionally, we conducted a cost benefit analysis of the project both initally and as it is sustained in future years.</p>
